		<h2>New York Mets</h2>
		<h3>Year Established</h3>
		<p>The New York Mets were founded in 1962 to replace the New Yorks recently departed teams, the Dodgers and the Giants. The nickname "Mets" was adopted: it was a natural shorthand to the club's corporate name, "The New York Metropolitan Baseball Club, Inc.", hearkened back to the "Metropolitans" (a former New York team in the American Association from 1880 to 1887), and its brevity was advantageous for newspaper headlines.</p>
		<h3>Home Stadium</h3>
		<p>For the first two years of its existence, the team played its home games at the historic  Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan. In 1964, they moved into newly constructed Shea Stadium in Flushing, Queens, where the Mets played until the 2008 season. In 2009, the club moved into Citi Field, adjacent to the former Shea Stadium site.</p>
		<h3>Championshipos</h3>
		<p>During their history, the Mets have won two World Series titles (1969) and [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_World_Series)), five National League [pennants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Championship_Series) (1969, [1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_NLCS), [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_NLCS), [2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_NLCS), [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_NLCS)) and six [National League East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East) titles (1969, 1973, 1986, 1988, 2006, 2015). The Mets also qualified for the [postseason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason)as the National League [wild card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_wild_card) team in 1999, 2000, and 2016. The Mets have appeared in five World Series, more than any other [expansion team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team) in MLB history. Their two championships are the most titles among expansion teams, equal to the tallies of the [Toronto Blue Jays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays), [Miami Marlins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins), and [Kansas City Royals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals).</p>

		<h2>New York Jets</h2>
		<h3>Year Established</h3>
		<p>The first organizational meeting of the American Football League took place on August 14, 1959.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-AFL_meeting-12) [Harry Wismer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Wismer), representing the city of New York at the meeting, proclaimed the state was ready for another professional football team and that he was more than capable of running the daily operations.[[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-AFL_meeting-12)</p>
		<p>Wismer was granted the charter franchise later dubbed the Titans of New York as Wismer explained, "Titans are bigger and stronger than [Giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants)."[[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-13) He secured the Titans' home field at the decrepit Polo Grounds, where the team struggled financially and on the field during its first three years.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-14) By 1962, the debt continued to mount for Wismer, forcing the AFL to assume the costs of the team until season's end.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-15)</p>
		<p>A five-man syndicate, headed by [Sonny Werblin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Werblin), saved the team from certain bankruptcy, purchasing the lowly Titans for $1 million.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-Year_In_Review:_1963-16) Werblin renamed the team the New York Jets since the team would play in [Shea Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium) near [LaGuardia Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaGuardia_Airport).[[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-17) The new name was intended to reflect the modern approach of his team.</p>
		<h3>Home Stadium</h3>
		<p>Under new ownership, the current name was adopted in 1963 and the franchise moved to [Shea Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shea_Stadium) in 1964 and then to the [Meadowlands Sports Complex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meadowlands_Sports_Complex) in 1984.</p>
		<p>Defeated, the Jets agreed to enter a 50â€“50 partnership with their rival, the Giants, to build a new stadium effectively agreeing to a 99-year lease, which the Giants had signed earlier in the year, to remain in New Jersey.[[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-nytimes-50) The stadium, known as MetLife Stadium, became the first in the history of the NFL to be jointly built by two franchises.</p>
		<p>The team's training facility, Atlantic Health Jets Training Center,[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-9) which opened in 2008, is located in Florham Park.[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-10) The team currently holds their annual [training camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp_(National_Football_League)) sessions in Florham Park, New Jersey.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-11)</p>
		<h3>Championships</h3>
		<p>The Jets' owners hired [Weeb Ewbank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weeb_Ewbank) as the general manager and head coach.[[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-Year_In_Review:_1963-16) Ewbank and quarterback [Joe Namath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Namath) led the Jets to prominence in 1969, when New York defeated the heavily favored Baltimore Colts in [Super Bowl III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_III)[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets#cite_note-Year_In_Review:_1969-7) and solidified the AFL's position in the world of professional football.</p>

		<h2>New York Knicks</h2>
		<h3>Year Established</h3>
		<p>The team, established by [Ned Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Irish) in 1946, was one of the founding members of the [Basketball Association of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_Association_of_America) (BAA), which became the NBA [after merging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association#Creation_and_merger) with the rival [National Basketball League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_League_(United_States)) (NBL) in 1949. Along with the [Boston Celtics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics), the Knicks are one of only two original NBA teams still located in its original city.</p>

They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other is the [Brooklyn Nets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets).</p>
		<h3>Championships</h3>
		<p> It was not until the late 1960s when [Red Holzman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Holzman) became head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in [1970](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969%E2%80%9370_NBA_season) and [1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1972%E2%80%9373_NBA_season). The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals.</p>
